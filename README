This project was something I worked on when I worked at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the spring of 2023. The deliverable was a dataset in .csv format to be analyzed by the Epidemiology/Biostatistics team at MSK.
The files within this repository are as follows:

active-patient-cohort.sql
  This SQL is the start of the creation of the cohort of patients analyzed. It looks at the patients during the time period of 4/6/2022 to 5/6/2022 (6 months pre and post CURES deployment) who had any type of encounter in the 2 months before the week of interest.
